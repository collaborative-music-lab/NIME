#X text 29 269 RATE - playback speed of sample;
#X text 29 288 START - point in the sample to begin playing back;
#X text 29 310 LENGTH - how much of the sample to play back;
#X text 29 331 LINK - links RATE and LENGTH so changes in LENGTH result
in a consistent pitch;

#X text 31 608 EOC - triggers when the sampler loops;
#X text 31 579 OUT - audio output;
#X text 32 487 START - cv input for START;
#X text 32 505 LENGTH - trigger input for LENGTH;
#X text 31 456 RATE - cv input for RATE. Note that this is in Hz \,
and adds to the slider value.;
#X text 31 407 TRIG - trigger input to play sample in 1SHOT mode. This
inlet also accepts 'read <filename>' \, 'open' (opens file browser)
\, and 'link <0/1>' messages.;
#X text 25 52 The WAVE-SAMPLER module can load a single sample \, and
play the sample back with variable speed and length. The rate control
determines the playback speed of the sample \, with a value of 1 (furthest
right on the slider) playing the sample at its original speed and pitch.
The segment of the sample that is played is determined by the START
and LENGTH controls. Start determines how far into the sample it begins
to play back \, and length the amount of the sample to play back. The
LINK control links RATE and LENGTH so that the pitch determined by
RATE is maintained as LENGTH is modulated. Note that the RATE is not
always updated in sync with length \, so it may take a cycle for the
rate to catch up to changes in length.;
