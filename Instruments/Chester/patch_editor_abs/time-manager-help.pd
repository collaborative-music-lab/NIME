#X text 21 47 The "TIME-MANAGER" module is basically an 8-step trigger
sequencer where you set the time for each step (between 1-120 seconds).
There are individual step outputs as well as an output for every trgger
(ALL). The main purpose of the TIME-MANAGER is to structure larger
compositions by triggering events at a slower pace. It is a more precise
tool than using multiple clock-dividers or slow lfos. The SYNC input
is essential for the module to work \; you have to patch any musically
relevant trigger source into this input. The TIME-MANAGER will then
use this sync source to output triggers in sync with your patch. If
it counts to 60 seconds \, it will not produce a trigger right away
when reaching 60 \, it will wait until it receives a trigger at the
sync input. You can manually start and stop the module with the START/STOP
button or with the START/STOP input.;
#X text 18 307 8 sliders - set the time in seconds for each step;
#X text 18 337 START - start or stop the counter;
#X text 17 368 RESET - reset the counter;
#X text 18 396 LOOP - if loop is disabled \, the module will perform
the 8 steps and the stop. If loop is enabled it will perform the steps
over and over again.;
#X text 456 376 SYNC - trigger input for any musically relevant trigger
source from you patch to sync the outputs of the TIME-MANAGER;
#X text 456 424 START/STOP - trigger input for the START/STOP function
