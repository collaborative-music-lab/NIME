Getting started with Wekinator

1. Run the ChesterWiki.py script.
- this will stream acc and gyro data to wekinator
- wekinators port # is 6448 (set on line 39 of ChesterWiki)
2. Open Wekinator
- set output port to 5005 (the port PD listens on)
- set input # inputs to 6
- click next
3. Open the ChesterWiki PD patches (ctrl and main)
- the wekinator mappings are at the bottom of the ctrl patch
- wekinator outputs the message /wek/outputs and then a list of floats form 0-1
- in chesterWikiCtrl these are scaled to 0-127 and sent to automatonism modules
4. In Wekinator create a mapping by:
- drag the sliders for outputs 0-5 to change filter frequencies
- when you’ve found a set of outputs you like, hold the IMU in a fixed position
- click ‘start recording’ to record the inputs, and stop recording when you’ve gathered some samples
- repeat with new sets of inputs and outpus
5. Play your mapping by clicking train and then clicking run
