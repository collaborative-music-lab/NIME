Carina and Alonso
* putting things in bottles!
* bottles on tables and also suspended from above (w/lighting)
* fluid dripping out of holes
* unsounding objects 

Grace, Fred, Tagoe
* highly manipulable interfaces
	* stretch, rip, squish
* limited amount of clay?
	* can pause sensing while working to make next shape
* sand art on lighted surface
	* khladni patterns?
* sensing
	* resistivity
	* optical clarity
	* capacitance
	* ‘noisy jelly’

Tareq, Reed, Savoldy
* paint using copper brushes over conductive pads
* drip wateron surface to change resistivity between pads
* water jugs with amount of water changing pitch
