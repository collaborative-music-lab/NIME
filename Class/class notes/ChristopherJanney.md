Maintenance
* 1 persons job just to remote into installations every two weeks to make sure it is working
* Also someone local supposed to be watching it (probably in the organization that commissioned it)
* always make extra components / in his studio shelves of spare parts

Cambridge Light shadow (Reed)
* basically a MIDI controller
	* pitch table
	* progression table
	* bank of timbres
	* limits number of simultaneous notes
		* max of 8 or 16 notes
		* avoid denisty of sound
	* spread out over 16 channels in the wall
	* 200 sensors / lights / speakers
		* each 
* sound good
* daily use
* organization of pitches / sounds
	* pentatonic scales
	* rhythmic quanitzation
* localization of sound
* how to determine when a note is triggered
* quantization - rhythmically
* changes over time
	* progression moves root note of table
	* change chord over time or over activity
		* after every 25 triggers
	* on a slow day changes happen less often / may be triggered by time rather than activity
	* score happens over minutes and hours
* special events
	* new puzzles designed by students
* how do you encourage longer interactions?
* Expectations
	* confidence that I am successfully interacting
	* mystery - response may change and be unexpected
	* don’t want to make it into a science project
* Project management
	* making sure the physical elements are well organized
	* prevents physical challenges from getting in the way of designing the artistic experience


Disembodied instruments / heartbeat
* entrainment
	* when listening to a regular rhythm close to your heartbeat you heartbeat may begin to synchronize with the rhythm
* heartbeat
	* reflect both the medical function of heaet
	* and also the spiritual / emotional connection
	* important that we associate the sound we hear with her heartbeat
	* design of the sound system is so important  - in this context for strong low frequency that we feel
	* Francis ford coppola - 75% of my films are in the sound
	* ‘the art of conversation’ coppola with gene hackman film
	* walter murch - sound editor for coppola
	* sound is direct from the machine
		* filter out all high end to focus on low end
* how to use heartbeat in other applications
	* preserving original rhythm emphasizes its fragility / variability
	* using an average to derive tempo over longer term
	* copernican shift: changing the way we perceive, to understand a phenomenon in a new way

Programming installations for special occasions
* Revel sonic fireflies
	* beyonce was looking for a place to perform after her first child
	* compose a piece for fireflies based on beyonces music
		* conditions: need to talk to beyonce
		* need unmixed tracks for a song “the end of time”
		* model of interaction / experience stays the same but sonic material changed
