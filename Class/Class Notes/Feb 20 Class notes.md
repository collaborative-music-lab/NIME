# Abstract: What aesthetic values are implied by the language used here? 
This article pinpoints a specific movement within the broad spectrum of music technology to identify a musical and instrument-building tradition concerned with gesture. This area of research and creative practice, often labeled NIME after the international conference series New Interfaces for Musical Expression, goes beyond enhancing traditional instru­ ment performance practice to looking at new paradigms for instrumental performance. This article focuses on musically driven efforts to exploit analog and digital technologies to capture musical gesture and afford new forms of sonic articulation and musical expres­ sion. It retraces the history of music technology in the twentieth century that led up to the founding of NIME and introduces composers and performers who have established a performance practice on interactive, sensor-based musical instruments. Finally, it finishes by indicating current directions in the field, including the musical exploitation of biomet­ ric signals and location-tracking technologies. 

# Definition of an instrument
the instrument makes the sound, you just interact with it (unless its the voice)
intention

### What is the difference between a tool and an instrument?

tool is used
good for one thing
clear defintion
tools purpos eis to push the bounds of what an instrumetn can do
used in the process
### instrument
experieence of interacting
intention makes it an instrument
improvement might change interaction
instrument is played
lots of expression but cost of complexity
aboutt hee person, help to connect to the esound (emotionally)
emotional experience is a form of utility
fuzzy definition of what is good

# Definition of an instrument

### How does turntablism challenge prexisting ideas of the definition of “musical instruments”?
content: what elements is the instrument built on, and how do they impact the aesthetics of the capabilities and output?
context: where, when, how, and who: how does human action create musical experiences
configuration: what other elements are involved in the overall musical experience? What role does our instrument play?
### What is the difference between a tool and an instrument?
Ultimately,  human experience and judgement are used to evaluate how successful an instrument is.
