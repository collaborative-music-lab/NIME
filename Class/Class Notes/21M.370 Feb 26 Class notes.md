# 21M.370 Feb 27 Class notes

## Plan for today
1. Group research project
2. Response 3
3. Lab 3 preview
4. Lab check-in

### Feb 28: Nobby install & modification

### March 4: Group research project 1 / Response 4
### March 6: Group research project 2 / Nobby performance

## Response 3
Some Human/Artistic Principles
1. Programmability is a curse
2. Smart instruments are often not smart
3. Copying an instrument is dumb, leveraging expert technique is smart 
4. Some players have spare bandwidth, some do not
5. Make a piece, not an instrument or controller
6. Instant music, subtlety later

Some Technological Principles
7. MIDI = Miracle, Industry Designed, (In)adequate 
8. Batteries, Die (a command, not an observation) 
9. Wires are not that bad (compared to wireless)

Some Other Principles
10. New algorithms suggest new controllers
11. New controllers suggest new algorithms
12. Existing instruments suggest new controllers
13. Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers


 ### Thoughts on reading
 organization of paper - cross referecing prinicples
 design an instrument for the player not the designer
 reference dieter rams 10 principles for good design
 don norman & nielson  ( look for website )

Tradeoff between configuring a system and making music
Cognitive bandwidth
* Balancing physical resources and cognitive resources is tricky
Audience experience and how transparent the creation process is
Not coping existing instruments
Ge Wang - Artful Design

Let interaction/sound guide the design process

Instant music - where is the creation taking place?
* Training wheels

Instant gratification promotes longer engagement
* knowledge gained by yourself is more valuable than something implicitly provided

### Nobby

Euclidian algorithm
Writing into a sequencer
