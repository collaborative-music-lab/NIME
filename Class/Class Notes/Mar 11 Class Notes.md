# [370] [s24] jorda pt1 class notes

Richard:
Jordà is approaching the process of creating new musical instruments scientifically while Cook considers it to be “more art than science” going as far to say that “[perhaps] this is the only way it can be done” (Cook, 2001). We can see this further from what both authors devote their time to. Cook talked about the various rules that he found but most were creatively focused e.g. “Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers” or “Copying an instrument is dumb, leveraging”. On the other hand Jordà is more concerned with developing a scientific discipline for making instruments. He devotes an entire section (section 3) just talking about the taxonomies of different instruments and noting that where we fit digital instruments into existing western taxonomies is unknown. In this sense another difference between the two is how much they seem to be thinking about existing instruments. Cook makes little mention of other instruments seeming most interested in new controllers or algorithms, Jordà is concerned about how these new portions of instruments fit into the larger collective. 

 

I think personally my perspective is closer to Cook. As someone with little existing musical experience I’m not concerned with how something I make fits in on a larger scale. I’d be really happy to make something that I thought sounded good even if it was a “idiosyncratic instrument” (Jordà) only used by me. I think digital instruments are exciting as an application of the electrical engineering I’m learning here and I’m less interested in why digital instruments haven't had much commercial success yet or how they should be categorized.

 

I was a little confused about what exactly microstructural and macrostructural meant, but my interpretation was that a microstructural control was being able to adjust the decay rates in Puredata on Nobby while the macrostructural was having the various buttons to click which triggered the samples. I’m interested in exploring microstructural control mediums. I really resonated with Cook’s advice to make "amusing instruments” and I find it most interesting to try to put musical instruments into funny or unexpected places. I agree with both authors that an instrument can be too smart, however I did find the discussion about the instrument knowing the sequence of notes you should play interesting. It is places like this, where existing instruments are demanding more memory than creatively that I think instruments should be smarter.

Jose:
Jordà’s viewpoint differs from Cooks’ in one major regard: the success of more recent musical instruments. Jordà sums up his perspective on this topic into two sentences: “many new instruments are being invented. Too little striking music is being made with them.” Cook, however, sees the ingenuity in these new instruments by commenting on the novel aspects that these instruments bring to the table: Cook does not see popularity as success, but rather how well the instruments can evoke positive emotions. In terms of my own perspective, I do think that both sides have some merit. I do believe that no instrument conceived in the 21st century has achieved the success of, say, the Mini Moog, but I also do think that these new instruments can and do provide the audience with riveting emotions.

Most recently, Knobby has been a fine example of microstructural vs macrostructural control; the was the player interacts with the knobs and buttons help add human emotion at the macrostructural level, while the mappings of those inputs to certain parameters onto patches in Pure Data allow for a multitude of sounds chosen by the player to be generated. As for exploration, I currently have two interests in mind: sensor inputs and signal processing. In particular, I have an interest in wanting to explore different sensors for performance, such as using an IMU to simulate a driving wheel, or utilizing signal processing algorithms to take a recorded vocal phrase to map onto musical pitches that can then be sequenced.  

In terms of instrument intelligence, I have also thought of perhaps implementing a markov note transition matrix into my instrument, wherein the player can adjust the probabilities for the transition from one note to another starting from an initial state. In that sense, I think the instrument might become “smart” since it deduces future pitches from initial pitches, but in this case, the human still has the ability to control the decision process; however, I do foresee there being problems in getting caught in recurrent loops, alluding to the problems that might arise from trying to make a “smart” instrument as foretold by Cook.

Lleyton:
Jordà references and quotes Cook multiple times, and the two don't seem to have greatly different perspectives overall. The most notable difference between the two texts is the voice in which the authors chose to write. Cook delivers and supports his principles for digital instrument design by using specific examples of digital instruments throughout history, taking an analytical approach to examine the challenges and advantages of each and applying them to the concept as a whole. Jordà, while similarly pragmatic and clearly experienced with and knowledgeable about the realm of digital music, takes a more high-level approach, focusing on defining principles such as micro- and macro-structural control rather than breaking down specific examples of instruments. Some examples of macro-structural control we've seen so far in 21M.370 include sampling (which makes a decision about some aspect of the overall structure/sound of a piece beforehand) and synth presets (which alter the space of an instrument's overall sound output), while we've seen micro-structural control in the ring of the Ondes Martenot or the ability to alter most, if not all, factors that go into sound generation in PureData such as decay and waveform. I feel that microstructural control will be very interesting for me to explore, as I believe my final project will be designed to accompany singing, so I'd like to be able to control small aspects of the sound to fit with certain singing techniques and styles. In terms of intelligence, I'd like to control much of the sound production of my instrument live and on the spot, but I will need some degree of intelligence (possibly in the form of an algorithm based on sound data analysis) to set the scale in which I am singing and allow my instrument to accompany me based on which note I am singing in the scale.

Eva:
Jordà vs Cook
 

The difference between Jordà and Cooks’ perspectives may derive from their background. Jordà's background emphasizes the player-instrument relationship and the experiential aspects of music performance, so he cares more about the dynamic relationship between players and instruments, exploring concepts like efficiency, apprenticeship, and learning curve. He delves into the properties of musical instruments and their impact on the player's interaction and expression. Cook's background in computer music and digital signal processing focuses more on the technical and algorithmic aspects of music creation and manipulation. For example, Cook argues that the instrument should enable immediate and transparent musical expression, as illustrated in his principle “Instant music, subtlety later”, while Jordà promotes a dynamic relationship between players and instruments.

 

From my perspective on music and performance, these insights are invaluable. Jordà’s view encourages considering how an instrument can grow with the performer, while Cook’s principles remind me of the importance of the initial design choices and their impact on performance. Instruments should offer a balance to allow for expressive and dynamic musical performances.

  

Microstructural vs Macrostructural Control
Microstructural control refers to the fine details of sound manipulation, while macrostructural control involves larger-scale changes in music, such as sections or entire pieces. Examples of microstructural control mentioned in the paper could include:

     - Adjusting the timing and phrasing of individual notes within a musical phrase.

     - Adding subtle variations in dynamics or articulation to create a more nuanced performance.

     - Fine-tuning the pitch or timbre of individual notes for expressive effect.

Examples of macrostructural control mentioned in the paper could include:

     - Controlling the overall structure of a musical piece, such as the arrangement of sections (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge).

     - Modifying the tempo or key of the entire composition to create different moods or effects.

     - Triggering changes in the harmonic progression or rhythmic patterns to shape the overall musical narrative.

Exploring macrostructural control seems particularly interesting to me, as I can control the overall structure and add more emotion to it.

 

‘Intelligent’ Instruments
 

An intelligent instrument, in my view, should not be overly complex in its interaction. It should offer a level of simplicity that allows the performer to express themselves without feeling overwhelmed by the technology. This balance between complexity and usability is crucial; the instrument should serve as an extension of the performer’s body and mind, not a barrier.

 

In designing such instruments, I would focus on creating systems that provide feedback to the performer, not just in terms of sound but also through visual or tactile cues. This multimodal interaction could enhance the learning process and make the instrument feel more like a responsive partner than a mere tool. A good intelligent instrument should empower musicians to push the boundaries of their creativity, offering new ways to explore sound and performance without imposing limitations.

Val:
Cook has a more rigid sense of what makes an instrument, made clear by his list of principles used to describe them. However, Jordà says “We need useful, playable, thought-provoking enjoyable instruments, capable of interesting, surprising, enjoyable music,” which feels like he views the definition of what makes an instrument as up to the player. He also states that digital lutherie should be treated as a craftsmanship, not as a science, since they may sometimes produce a work of art. This way of describing instruments further indicates that he has a looser and more creative view on what an instrument is.

The text says that microstructural changes involve texture and timbrical adjustments. Examples of microstructural control include making specific modifications to the way that a digital instrument is mapped. Filters, oscillators, and modulators can all be finely tuned and adjusted to change sonic outputs. Macrostructural control involves changes to the musical form. This includes things like changing the instrument design itself, like the layout and interface that users interact with. Choosing what controls, buttons, sliders, etc are available to the user to interact with as well as how they are laid out on the instrument itself are both examples of macrostructural control. Coming from a mechanical engineering background, I am more drawn to the idea of exploring macrostructural control, and creating a unique way for users to interact with an instrument and create sound.

I am of the opinion that trying too hard to make “intelligent” instruments that correct any and all mistakes made by the player ruin what I see as live music. Live music has its imperfections, since it is being performed by humans. If you want a perfect performance, you can simply program a computer to do so, but it lacks the charm and emotion behind it that a human would be able to give. When I design my instrument, I don’t plan on using much “intelligence” behind it.

Cook:
From first impressions, Cook seems to be someone who wants to set certain limits and expectation on what cannot and shouldn't be done when it comes to digital instrument design.  Contrary to that, Jorda looks for and points out exceptions to what Cook establishes.  In practically al parts of life, it's important to be able to not just take things for their face value and get your own perspective on things.  Had Jorda just taken what Cook said, they likely would not have found the insight they present in their research paper.  For me, I will certainly have to do plenty of experimenting and trying to go against what others have established so I can get what I want.  It will likely be an arduous task but it would be worth it.  Of course this not to say that one should ignore all advice, it's good to put faith in advice, but the limit should be strictly following said advice.  

To be completely honest, I don't think I would want my instrument to be smart at all.  I understand that it would defeat a major design possibility that comes with digital instruments, but I just prefer the "one gesture to one acoustic event" system.  Maybe I'm just old fashion, but I couldn't envision myself being happy playing an instrument that decided things for me to some degree.  I could see myself coming around on this in the future depending on what I settle on for final design, but at the moment I really want to leave the actual music playing to me.  Then again, the nobby lab has for sure lowered my expectations on what I could actually get done for a final project.  Truthfully, nobby lab is making me rethink a lot.  I originally had in mind making an instrument in the shape of a bow and arrow to go for a "digital archer" aesthetic but yeah, nobby really helped show me my own limitations both time-wise, design-wise, and actual music composition-wise.

Amir:
How do Jordà and Cooks’ perspectives differ? Why? How is this relevant to your own perspective on music & performance?
Based on the tone of these two papers, I noticed that Cook does not look over the limitations of the field of digital music instrument design, and he proposed some principles that help to expand the design. However, Jorda mentions that “Everything is too much” and explains that adding too many parameters to control in an instrument is not necessarily useful to a player. Additionally, both believe that a new algorithm for music synthesis suggests a new instrument or a new controller can suggest a new algorithm. However, Jorda believes that in digital instrument design, the sound generation is completely separate from the controller part. One thing that Jorda focuses on is that there have been lots of inventions in this field although a few of the designs made it to the market. Personally, I did not know that there were some digital music instruments other than MIDI before taking this class. One of the reasons, as Jorda mentions, is that the majority of the inventions still use mouse or keyboards.

What examples of microstructural vs macrostructural control have we seen so far? What kinds of control seem interesting for you to explore?
Macrostructural controls are harmony, melody, and rhythm, which are pretty common in classical music. However, microstructural control is about the quality of the sound, which in traditional instruments is highly dependent on the type of the instrument. Microstructural control is more interesting to me because in traditional instruments, once a player picks an instrument, they do not have control over the microstructural components. They can play different rhythms, tempos, and harmonies, but cannot change the quality of the sound.

Both authors are concerned with the idea of ‘intelligent’ instruments. What kinds of intelligence do you see yourself engaging with in instrument design?
With modern instruments, players can upload the score on the instrument ahead of time, and the instrument can control some components of the music. When the instrument knows the next note ahead of time, it can make some real-time changes or fix the players’ mistakes. However, I do not believe that these features make an instrument intelligent because a player can adapt to these features and still manipulate the performance.

Aria:
Jordà quotes Cook multiple times throughout the section. Cook suggests that control design can be determined using discoveries made during synthesis algorithm development while Jordà emphasizes that this is limiting. You can step away from single-control-to-single-sound-event paradigms. Jordà expands the perspective further stating that music making with digital instruments doesn't have to be sound synthesis only, but can function on a higher macrostructural level. I agree with and understand where Jordà is coming from here. Considering that some of the greatest successes with new digital instruments have come from the introduction of a new way of experiencing and interacting with music (as compared to the common interaction paradigms associated with acoustic instruments), viewing digital instruments as an opportunity to perform on a macrostructural or even compositional level allows for a higher, abstracted level of creativity that builds naturally on the understanding of music production on a single acoustic instrument level.

 

We've seen some examples of macrostructure in some of the presentations we've had in class so far. One of the most interesting was the Touché. It builds off of a lot of intuitive movements that you can associate with macro-level ideas such as rounding out a phrase or changing the timbre of a pitch sequence. These are higher-level controls as compared to the press-play-note experience you might get with a keyboard.

 

All of this loops back to the concept of an "intelligent" instrument. I found that the GROOVE project that is mentioned aligns well with my plan for adding intelligence to my final project. My current idea for my instrument design is something that allows some pre-performance composition/ allows me to play on a compositional level. With so much control over the output sound waves, determining pitches for general clarity in the sound during a performance is a lot of additional mental effort that I would like to avoid. I did something very similar (pre-defined chord progressions/ limiting notes to in-key scale degrees) for my Nobby design so it's nice to see that others view this imposed musical limitation positively.

Jake:
The introduction of digital instruments truly opened up the musical landscapes to endless possibilities. However with it, the very essence of music and the concept of instrument capabilities are being questioned. The author and Cook here don't exactly disagree on many main points brought up in the paper, but I would like to highlight their main disagreement on intelligent instruments and their future in music. By intelligent instruments, the author refers to instruments that adapt to a user and have algorithms that constantly shift the nature of the instrument. The author believes this is a new avenue, something that will push the boundary of what is possible for a musician, whereas Cook refers to this as a detriment. A feature that will lead to digital instruments being too easy to play, frustratingly adaptive, and decreasing the overall musicality of the user. Jordá's perspective is supported with the idea that these new features can open up new avenues for creativity and bridge the gap between composition and performance. Which I think can be a great advantage as an instrumental band may perform a piece that isn't exactly what the composer envisions. It is hard to perfectly communicate a composer's intentions. But with this new technology, a composer can finely tune the microstructural aspects of the music such as how the instruments blend, the dynamic, exact tempo, etc. , but can also affect the macrostructure of the piece. An intelligent instrument can analyze the direction of the piece as a whole, capture the emotions of the artists further than what they are inputting with aspects of the piece and adjust to match that. However, there is also the argument that these systems might be too complex for any one person/musician. How exact can we paint a piece? How precise can we truly pick out what we are meant to play? Sometimes musicality is an accident and the piece paints itself as you figure out what you are playing and I think this aspect is criminally underrated when talking about future instrument designs.

Andi:
Based on the tone and content of his paper, Jordà seems like a much more serious person than Cook. Whereas Cook views digital musical instrument design as an art, Jordà views it much more as a science (needing a robust taxonomy system, design method, etc.). As such, Jordà explicitly disagrees with Cook on two main ideas:

Cook argues that digital musical instruments should not be “smart” and just do exactly what the player tells them to do. Jordà argues that “smart” instruments that can predict and adapt to a player’s playing patterns would enable them to create better music.
Jordà disagrees with Cook’s design strategy of new algorithms suggesting new controllers and vice versa.
(I suspect that Jordà would also disagree with Cook’s argument that “funny is often much better than serious” too, seeing how he describes instruments becoming “toys” as if that’s a terrible thing.)

I agree with Cook that instruments shouldn’t be “smart” and try to predict what note I’ll play next, since that often doesn’t work in my experience and tends to limit the expressivity of an instrument. Jordà describes how in be-bop, a smart instrument may restrict the set of playable notes. However, that feels too much like permanent training wheels – it could limit what advanced players can do, and beginners could grow reliant on it.

In many ways, generative AI like ChatGPT feels like these kinds of smart instruments described by Jordà. It often works well and improves efficiency, but it stops you from thinking and being creative, which I think is a really bad thing.

The Nobby performances from this Wednesday were a great example of microstructural vs macrostructural control. In Grady’s performance, the “sparkling” effects he played exhibited macrostructural control – he didn’t control all the individual notes that played, but he did control the overall shape of the effect. The Euclidean rhythms of the drums would then be an example of microstructural control, since we control the individual note rhythms.

Nitu:

Based on a quick Google search, I found out that Cook leans toward the algorithmic and audio processing side of instrument design, while Jordà leans more on the physical interfaces side of instrument design. Meanwhile, in their philosophies, both Cook and Jordà believe in the importance of both the UI and software sides of digital instruments and liken their craft to art rather than science. The idea that the act of making something that produces art is an art from in and of itself is an idea that I find very beautiful.

Overall, I believe that Jordà pushes the boundaries of Cook philosophies. Jordà acknowledges Cook's synthesize → controller design approach and the idea that “smart” instrument aren’t all that smart, but he also claims that the possibilities for instrument intelligence and output are limitless and should not be reined in. I really like this concept and want to incorporate it into my instrument ideation by letting myself be more creative. I’m excited to play around with all of the “intelligence” that computers allow me to incorporate, including timbral, rhythmic, and polyphonic capabilities that would not be possible on an analog instrument.

More specifically, I am most interested in the microstructural aspects of music control, such as changing each note’s waveform, envelope, and pitch, rather than the macrostructural form of music, such as the form of musical compositions and performances. This is because I feel that working on microstructural control will allow me to explore the nitty-gritty of how a digital instrument works and fine-tune each output to my liking. However, the “integration of these two musical poles at the compositional level,” as mentioned by Jordà, might be the most interesting and innovative exploration of all! This is because this merger is discouraged by common practice, and therefore may lead to completely new music styles and sounds.

Grady:
I thought this reading was interesting, but I didn't understand why the author is spending so much time on trying to build a framework to categorize digital instruments. This is a feeling that is often brought up for me - I often get easily frustrated during conversations over what kind of artists belong in which genres and the like. I understand that categorizing different things can help us analyze and think about them, but for me, I just don't feel like so much time should be spent doing so. I think the rest of the spends more time developing methods for analyzing new instruments, and I think that is very useful. Its just the "categorization" - for instance, the long discussion of the "taxonomy" of different musical instruments. Why does it matter so much? 

 

Changing subjects, I think the concept of microstructrual vs. macrostructural control are very interesting. For instance, with Nobby, we had very microstructural control - we controlled when samples were played, their timbre, their overlapping rythms, etc. Not much was preprogrammed except the samples themselves and the sequence, and even that could be rewritten live. However, with something like the JavaCup from Cook's paper, where interactions with the sensors affect parameters of a generative music algorithm, that is an example of macrostructural control. At first, I felt like macrostructural control felt like taking too much away from the musician. I think this is because from my perspective as a guitar player, I want to be able to control each and every pitch I play, the dynamics of it, the rhythm, etc. But I think it could be really interesting to combine elements of both, which I think is what Jorda was referencing a lot with intelligent instruments. An instrument that has some pre-programmed knowledge, but the performer can interact with it in both a macro and micro structural manner. That is the kind of instrument I am interested in pursuing further.

Alicia:
One point that Jordà and Cook seem to have differing perspectives on are the rules and guidelines for designing new digital instruments. In the paper, Jordà explicitly takes one of Cook’s sentences about musical interface construction being an art and clarifies that he considers it a craftsmanship instead. In addition, Jordà seems to have a more open perspective on intelligent instruments, although he does mention that they are tricky to work with. Jordà seems more open to the idea of programmable, intelligent instruments that can generate newer and more creative forms of music or offer distinct human-instrument interactions compared to traditional instruments. On the other hand, Cook developed a set of principles surrounding digital instruments that seems a little more rigid and less open to exploring certain aspects of digital instruments. 

 

Some examples of microstructural control are internal settings of the instrument, such as the timbre and type of sound generated by certain parts of the instrument. This can be similar to the internal settings we have on PureData for our instruments. Macrostructural control is more related to how the performer plays the instrument and how they can use different gestures or actions to change the sound. For example, this would be us pressing a button or adjusting the potentiometer when performing, or Atau Tanaka using different hand gestures during a performance on the EMG. 

 

In terms of music and performance, I think diverse perspectives on music and performance are important to help see different advantages and disadvantages of a certain method for designing an instrument. I think Jordà’s points about exploration and creating impactful new musical instruments is important, but I also appreciate the guidance that I can get from Cook’s principles. For intelligent instruments, I can see myself interacting with basic elements of instrument intelligence, such as the idea where the instrument knows which notes are in the key and can make those notes more easily accessible than out of key notes. However, I would probably not really want to work with instruments that have enough intelligence for something like interactive composing.

Gail:

1. How do Jordà and Cooks’ perspectives differ? Why? How is this relevant to your own perspective on music & performance?
It seems like they’re somewhat on the same page about the necessity of designging the sound synthesis mechanism first, then working with controlling and shaping the sound in a somewhat cyclical manner—meaning, they both don’t necessarily believe that sound synthesis needs to come before sound manipulation. Jorda’s opinion on the “bounds” of instrument design seem more flexible than Cook’s though, as he indicates that part of the beauty of instrument design is considering how the sound will be shaped with intent. 

2. What examples of microstructural vs macrostructural control have we seen so far? What kinds of control seem interesting for you to explore?
Microstructural control in musical instruments involves the manipulation of individual parameters related to the production of sound. It includes techniques or adjustments that directly affect the nuances and details of the sound at a small scale. This could look like adjusting the embouchure on a wind instrument, altering the pressure and position of fingers on a string instrument, or varying the way you hit a percussion instrument.
Macrostructural control, on the other hand, involves broader manipulations that influence the overall characteristics of the sound produced by the instrument. It focuses on controlling larger elements that shape the general timbre, volume, or expression of the instrument. This could look like adjusting the overall dynamics, using a mute on a brass instrument, changing the bowing technique on a string instrument, or manipulating the foot pedals on a piano.
I’m particularly interest in microstructural control—I love sound design and focusing on the minute details of how an instrument sounds in its “natural” state, not necessarily warping the design of a pre-existing form to develop a new sound.

3. Both authors are concerned with the idea if ‘intelligent’ instruments. What kinds of intelligence do you see yourself engaging with in instrument design?
I see myself engaging in designing aspects of novel interfaces—that is, developing seamless and intuitive products that demystify music production for the average Joe. As technology rapidly evolves our world, I feel like there is a never-ending pull to make “intelligent” instruments that are complicated to use, but offer new paradigms of interaction. That said, I’d like to keep the sound synthesis and mapping as clear as possible to create satisfying and easily controllable instruments.
