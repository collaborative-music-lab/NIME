Val: Cook takes inspiration from what is readily available, while Jordà expands on it. For example, the Cook article talked a lot about instruments that Cook tried to recreate, like the voice, the trumpet, even the JavaMug was recreating a known experience. However, Jordà says in the introduction that there are no laws to follow, even comparing digital lutherie to an art, which is more relevant to my own perspective on music and performance.

Yohan: the smartest algorithm will never cater to every performer’s whims and biases, and it’s often best to offer less to permit more expression.

Elaine: Jorda adds that digital instruments can be good because they allow a lower barrier to entry. However, he then poses the question, does this take away from what the musician understands of the music itself?

Andrew Li: I’m very interested in capturing nontraditional cues in music and using them as part of the feedback system. For example: stank faces or physical movements when you’re playing something with lots of energy and intensity. These are as much a part of the player and audience experience as the music!

Karima: I would be curious to explore / see examples of instruments that provide a more organized / curated design space for sound texture that frees the musician from one fixed texture as is the case with traditional instruments, but also provides more useful structure than arbitrary programming. . . interactive music systems is performer and assistant, where the instrument is capable of performing intelligent tasks which are explicitly requested for by the musician. . . .  [example] where “the player could select pitches from a set that would contain only the permitted pitches within the current chord or mode”.

Leo: I agree with Jorda in the sense that I would be interested in creating instruments that can create new types of music instead of making new instruments that are meant to play the types of music that already exist. I especially agree with her points in section 2.5 where she mentions that “the current situation and results can hardly be considered awesome” despite the endless possibilities offered by new instruments. This could be due to lack of exposure, but in my personal experience I have not come across a new type of instrument that seems as if it is pushing to create new kinds of music.

Joseph: the visual understanding of the complexities and skill involved contribute significantly to the performance, and wrapping too much microstructure control in macrostructural control risks damping that visual appeal.

Joyce: I am personally more interested in microstructural controls because I want to dig into the technical foundations of the music being produced, so I can fully understand how my actions might manipulate the sound at the very physical level. I believe the small changes at the microstructural level builds up to the changes that control the macrostructural level.

Vishruti: There is a common notion that the “scientific understanding of something” takes away from its beauty—and I disagree with this. I do believe that sometimes describing something precisely is the only way to represent it, and the same applies to musical definitions as well

Amie: absolutely agree with Cook’s idea that instrument creation’s ultimate goal is to use to enhance the current state of music and to propel its development, not necessarily to have a scientific breakthrough. It is more like utilizing one’s knowledge of science as an additional element to creating music because one’s own understanding of music and art is more integral to the process of instrument building.
