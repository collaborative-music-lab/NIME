## Response 3
Some Human/Artistic Principles
1. Programmability is a curse
- Yohan
- Andrew Li
2. Smart instruments are often not smart
- Andrew S.
- Vishruti
3. Copying an instrument is dumb, leveraging expert technique is smart 
4. Some players have spare bandwidth, some do not
- Val
5. Make a piece, not an instrument or controller
- Sophia
- Joseph
6. Instant music, subtlety later
- Miles
- Amie

Some Technological Principles
7. MIDI = Miracle, Industry Designed, (In)adequate 
8. Batteries, Die (a command, not an observation) 
9. Wires are not that bad (compared to wireless)

Some Other Principles
10. New algorithms suggest new controllers
- Karima
11. New controllers suggest new algorithms
12. Existing instruments suggest new controllers
13. Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers
- Joyce

Elaine: "Tanaka wrote that â€œmusical instruments evolve out of a synergistic relationship between developments in musical style and material craftsmanship",  highlighting how in some ways, technology advances too fast for musicians to do the same in music tech. . . I would be focusing much more on the relationship between the musician and the instrument rather than the amount of technical features I can add to the instrument."

Karima :"One could also argue that there is enough room for novelty within the parameter space of an arpeggiator that it's not stifling creativity. But I think it still stands that having instruments that can produce higher level structures of sound like arpeggiators that can pass for music forces musicians into more subtle differences in the music they generate. "

Austin: ""For programmers and composers, this provides an infinite landscape for experimentation, creativity, writing papers, wasting time, and never actually completing any art projects or compositions."
Ouch. I definitely agree. It's easy to get lost in the technical when you're excited about it. So I hereby pledge to prioritize artmaking."
