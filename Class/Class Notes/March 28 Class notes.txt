Working with continuous and discrete data
March 28 2022

discrete vs continuous data

Discrete data:
* avoiding double triggers
	- dead time
	- pattern matching
	- effect on detecting rapid changes
* on and off states
	- toggle and momentary
	- memory
* challenges with inconsistent communication
* converting to continuous data
* pitch

Continuous data
* data rates / jitter / dropped data / stairstepping
* converting to discrete events
	- thresholds, dead time, schmitt triggers
* smoothing
	- running calculations, buffers, sample history
	- mean, median, filters
	- fixed length buffer
		- keep track of sample order
		- or simply subtract average value
	- one-pole fiter
		out = alpha*prev + (1-alpha)*new
		0 < alpha < 1.0
		alpha typically between 0.5 and 0.999....
	- challenges:
		- responding to changes quickly
		- calculation efficiency
		- implementation efficiency
		- c.f. one-euro filter

* looking for change / delta
	- delta = new-prev
	- also called the derivative
	- insensitive to static offsets
	- generally combined with smoothing...
	- often absolute value of change is useful, for example for accumulation...

Accumulation
* keeps track of progress of data compared to a reference
* also called integration
* c.f. mouse position on screen or trumpet
* useful metaphor for physical interaction
* implementations:
	* pure integration: chording keyboards
	* leaky integration:
		- add each new sample to a bucket
		- for each new sample subtract some value (either fixed leak or fraction of stored value)
