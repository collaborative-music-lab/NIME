2. Basel & Ruanne Response
	* Basel & Ruanne talk about performance as being a big part of their process- and there are multiple levels of performers present. How would it feel to play a part in creating a work like this?
	* Much of this work is responding to and remixing previous performances. How might this change the emotional experience of creating the work? How does it make you feel as an observer?
	* What political/social/artistics contexts do you experience these works through. What challenges do your communities face, and how might you create work which might allow for the influence of these challenges? Note you do not need to directly address a challenge in order for your awareness of it to inform your process, and potentially the way it is received. 
	Responses:
	* using fragmented videos, audio, and text related to different people, events, and scenes to reconstruct history. What attracts me to such collaborative projects is that real history is inherently fragmented, pieced together from the memories of various individualsâ€”it can never be complete.
	* grounding the virtual in the visceral reality of shared human experience.
	* These articles were helpful in the sense that I know I should write down my feelings and ideas first. Then, I should start from there.
