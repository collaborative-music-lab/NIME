In your reflection, address a few of the following questions:
* How important is it that you are able to perceive/understand how the performer is interacting with the instrument? How is this accomplished?
	* Recorded music has no visual element per se
	* abtraction as a new development / what level of abstraction are we interested in perceiving
	* motor-mimesis
* How does the performance use material/programming assembled or created by the performer before-hand?
	* Why go to a live performance at all?
		* some kind of ephemerality
		* alllowance for improvisation
		* giving a window into the act of composing
			* llet audience into mental act of composing/performing the song
* What technical and musical concepts has the performer mastered in order to create this performance? Can you guess at the mental models they are using?
* What is the relationship between the instrument’s design, the performance gestures, and the style or aesthetic of the music? Is there a firm connection between these elements? What would you do if you wanted to perform a very different style of music with the same instrument / performance techniques?
* How does the performance and instrument reflect ‘low barrier to entry/no ceiling on virtuosity’?

Miles: In general, I find that I resonate more with a musical performance if I am able to understand how the performer is interacting with the instrument. I’ve thought about this a substantial amount throughout this course so far, and have come to the (tentative) conclusion that it is due to /inspiration/. As a musician, a musical performance is most meaningful to me if it inspires me in some way to create my own music. This isn’t restricted to wanting to produce similar music, but also wanting to engage in a similar creation process. Without a sense of /how/a piece is made, a performance doesn’t give a glimpse into the creation process. Even if a piece sounds impressive, if it is played in a way that is obscure or doesn’t seem enjoyable to perform myself, I am less inspired to create. Following from this, musical performance involving lots of pre-prepared material does not resonate with me as much. With the creation process obscured (much of it happening off-stage), I cannot put myself in the shoes of the performer.

I love the vocals paired with such physical motions that change parameters I usually think of as very opaque/behind the synthboard.
In that vein, I think it really elevates her performance being able to see how her movements affect the lushness of the sound (chords/chorus effect) and the volume, effects sweeps, etc. It adds a level of /visible/ /virtuosity/over an unknown interface that pulls the listener in. The wide range of programmable actions/gestures makes this possible: any software sound can be mapped to anything. The only limit is your desired mode of physical expression which can be paired with the sound.

Karima: 
with digital instruments like the MiMU gloves, the definition of virtuosity expands beyond physical dexterity, as is the case with traditional instruments, to also include the ability to build / manage / shape complex sound scapes, which may not necessarily require a lot of physical dexterity but requires a lot of mental dexterity. This makes it all the more important for these digital instruments to be designed and programmed such that that mental dexterity is as transparent to the audience as possible.
