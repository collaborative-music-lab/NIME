## sensor properties
* what are you measuring?
* What does the sensor detect
* Mechanical considerations
	* direct control over the thing which is being measured
	* Using sensors to detect Mechanical motion
* Sensor range 
	* linear/ nonlinear
	* Effective area/angle
* Ac vs dc signals
* Sampling rate
	* detecting sudden changes
	* See mbira esp32 code for over sampling technique
* Hysteresis
	* the amount of time a sensor needs to recover to the baseline
	* Response time
