## Jorda Article

Grady: digital luthier: aspiring towards beauty
enrique: efficiency - 
jose: odd quartet (quintet)
amir: diversity
eva: learning curve / efficiency (interaction of human and instrument changing over time)
aria: efficiency and diversity more important than learning curve
Andi: attempt to create a rigorous framework for analysis/design
- who is the audience? (gatekeeping, challenges to popularizing)
Richard: microstructure and macrostructure
Alicia: diversity

Instrument vs composition
Nobby: efficiency
- percussiion triggers: 6/10

microdiversity: how much variation can one peice of music have but still remain the same piece?
middiversity: how many differnt pieces can you play
macrodiversity: how easily can you play different styles?

## Topics: 
Design process, where to start- controller, synthesizer, composition
- And inadequate controllers will fatally lead to unsuccessful instruments.
Intelligent music systems - what kind of knowledge can it have?
- Tuning, pitch
- Tempo, time, rhythm 
- Timbre, coherence, mixing
- Form, melody, structure 
- Jorda's Reactable instrument https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgy1S8qymx0&t=34s
instrument vs co-player
- Responsive vs generative a la chadabe 
- Improviser like george lewis https://youtu.be/ncy4_FHX3Jc
one gesture to one acoustic event, few to many mapping
very few systems have been nourishing as well, capable of encouraging deeper exploration and continued discovery and creativity

*There is the desire on the part of some computer music researchers to create new instruments that should "know" what to do and require very little skill to play. Though this might allow beginners and amateurs to enter into music making quickly and enjoyably, this trend might ultimately limit a person's understanding of music. The question is whether these instruments will stimulate due to their immediate accessibility, or suffocate due to a kind of atrophy of learned musicality*
What is our understanding of music

## Pt. 2
Balance - challenge, frustration, boredom
* Dependent on user, culture, designer, individual
Playability, learnability
efficiency - why use complexity as input/ output dimension?
Spiegel: This doesn’t imply a dilution of musical quality. On the contrary, it frees us to go further and raises the base-level at which music making begins
diversity control:. A good instrument should not impose its music on the player.
Diversity 

### Instrument Diversity and Digital Instruments Corollaries

• An instrument must be able to play different pieces without the need of being reprogrammed; performers are not necessarily programmers 30 .
• Some instruments may have a “natural” high MidD; others may need to work with different configurations or setups.
• If different pieces need different setups, all these setups should not contradict the basic playability rules of the given instrument. Otherwise, we are not dealing with an instrument anymore, but with a variable controller+generator system.
• If setups are a must, the possibility to load them on the fly will promote improvisation
