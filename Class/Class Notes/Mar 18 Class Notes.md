2. Basel & Ruanne Response
	* Basel & Ruanne talk about performance as being a big part of their process- and there are multiple levels of performers present. How would it feel to play a part in creating a work like this? 
	* Much of this work is responding to and remixing previous performances. How might this change the emotional experience of creating the work? How does it make you feel as an observer? 
	* What political/social/artistics contexts do you experience these works through. What challenges do your communities face, and how might you create work which might allow for the influence of these challenges? Note you do not need to directly address a challenge in order for your awareness of it to inform your process, and potentially the way it is received.
