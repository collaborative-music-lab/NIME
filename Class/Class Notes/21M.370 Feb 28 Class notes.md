# 21M.370 Feb 28 Class notes

## Plan for today
1. Nobby overview
2. Lab 4 discussion
3. Lab 3 check-in
4. March 4 class on zoom!

## Nobby

Sensors
* buttons and pots - standard UI
* focus on gesture, not sensor
* when do changes happen? (wired, not wireless)
* python receives sensors in 'sensorInput.py'
	* when is data received?

Gestures
* excitation (instant music)
* selection
* modification
* shift-controls (multi-modality)

Algorithms
* how do we preserve instant music?
* what is a musical algorithm?

Nobby controls
* Buttons
	* drum triggers (enables?). Always starts euclid at beat 1
	* shift button. enable shift parameters
* Pots
	* with shift, edits enabled drum timbre & decay 
	* with shift, edits enabled drum pattern
	* synth sequence. chooses sequence step	
		* with shift, writes values into sequence
	* synth filter
* subtlety
	* interaction between drum voices, more noticeable with longer decay

Nobby performance?
* set euclid patterns and pitch sequence beforehand
* performance plans - explore extreme range of values

PD-to-python msgs
* look in defineOscHandlers()
* /clock: in PD for accurate timing (?)
* convenience for setting multiple parameters in PD
	* /setPitch:
	* /synthDetune:

python-to-PD msgs:
* generally in sendOSC() format:
sendOSC(objectType, instance, parameter, value)
* triggers are slightly different
* client.send_message("/trigger", triggerNum)
	* received by 'r trigger' object, and 'sel triggerNum'


## Nobby modifications

* Explore possibilities for different physical layouts, like Big Nobby.
* Add sensors to allow for different mappings. An obvious thing might be additional buttons to reduce the overloading of button 3 (where one button effects more than one thing).
* Modify the mapping - either changing parameter ranges, or controlling different parameters.
* you could even choose a completely different approach for algorithms - for example, deciding to precompose melodies for the pitch sequencer, and then interpolating between them somehow.
* Modify the automatonism patch - adding another voice perhaps, or making some other significant change. 
* You even might choose to modify Nobby to control the automatonism patch you created for lab 1.

### Examples
Sine wave pitch sequence
Changing PD samples /Nobby/pd/samples
* files must be named sample1.wav, sample2.wav, etc.
Changing PD patch
* modifying synth voice, for example
Adding sensors
* simplifying shift functions
