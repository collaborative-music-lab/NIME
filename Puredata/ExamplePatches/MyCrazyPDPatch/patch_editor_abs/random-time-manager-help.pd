#X text 21 47 The "RANDOM-TIME-MANAGER" module is giving out trigger
signals randomly within a range of seconds that you control with the
TIME and OFFSET sliders. The main purpose of the RANDOM-TIME-MANAGER
is to structure larger compositions by triggering events at a slower
pace. It is a less precise alternative to the TIME-MANAGER module.
The SYNC input is essential for the module to work \; you have to patch
any musically relevant trigger source into this input. The RANDOM-TIME-MANAGER
will then use this sync source to output triggers in sync with your
patch. If it counts to 60 seconds \, it will not produce a trigger
right away when reaching 60 \, it will wait until it receives a trigger
at the sync input. You can manually start and stop the module with
the ON/OFF button or with the ON/OFF input.;
#X text 20 313 OFFSET - control to set the minimun amount of possible
seconds (see MIN number box);
#X text 19 281 TIME - control to set the maximum amount of possible
seconds (see MAX number box;
#X text 19 383 COUNTER - number box that displays the counter;
#X text 19 426 RANDOM-VALUE - number box that displays what random-value
is currently chosen and what the COUNTER will work towards before receiving
a new random value.;
#X text 18 485 ON/OFF - toggle the counter on and off;
#X text 444 226 SYNC - trigger input for any musically relevant trigger
source from you patch to sync the outputs of the RANDOM-TIME-MANAGER
;
#X text 444 274 ON/OFF - trigger input for the ON/OFF function;
